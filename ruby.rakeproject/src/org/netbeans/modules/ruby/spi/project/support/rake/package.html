Principal package for implementing typical Ant-based projects.

<p>A typical project based on Ant follows a standard pattern of having a project
folder containing:</p>

<dl>

<dt><code>build.xml</code></dt>

<dd><p>A top-level editable build script.</p></dd>

<dt>various folders such as <code>src</code></dt>

<dd><p>Development files.</p></dd>

<dt>various folders such as <code>build</code></dt>

<dd><p>Build products. Not sharable in a VCS.</p></dd>

<dt><code>nbproject/build-impl.xml</code></dt>

<dd><p>Main logic for the build; regenerated from <code>nbproject/project.xml</code>
but sharable.</p></dd>

<dt><code>nbproject/project.xml</code></dt>

<dd><p>General project metadata, including a declaration of the type of project,
its name, some structural parameters relating to the build, a list of
subprojects, etc.</p></dd>

<dt><code>nbproject/project.properties</code></dt>

<dd><p>Sharable build configuration for the project.</p></dd>

<dt><code>nbproject/private/private.xml</code></dt>

<dd><p>Per-user (or per-checkout) project metadata, if any.</p></dd>

<dt><code>nbproject/private/private.properties</code></dt>

<dd><p>Per-user build configuration for the project.</p></dd>

<dt><code>nbproject/private/cache</code></dt>

<dd><p>Cache directory containing disposable files that might speed up various
operations.</p></dd>

</dl>

<p>Note that since Ant is not aware of the NetBeans Filesystems API, all these
files must be physically present on disk, not e.g. in an archive or remote
filesystem.</p>

<p>There may also be a file named <code>build.properties</code> located in the
NetBeans user directory which can supply additional definitions needed for a
build: e.g. the locations of Java platforms and libraries. A typical
<code>build-impl.xml</code> loads property definitions from this global
properties file as well as the project's
<code>nbproject/project.properties</code> and
<code>nbproject/private/private.properties</code>.</p>

<p>The basic operations commonly performed on an Ant-based project are:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Creation from wizard, including <code>build.xml</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>Loading metadata from disk.</p></li>

<li><p>Modifying metadata and build properties in memory, and subsequently saving
to disk.</p></li>

<li><p>Regenerating <code>nbproject/build-impl.xml</code>, typically based on
transforming <code>nbproject/project.xml</code> with an XSLT stylesheet.</p></li>

<li><p>Running a build target of a well-known name in <code>build.xml</code>
using Ant.</p></li>

<li><p>Enumerating important build outputs ("artifacts").</p></li>

<li><p>Adding dependencies on "subprojects" by getting information about their artifacts
and storing references to them.</p></li>

<li><p>Interpreting values of Ant properties found on disk, to be used in
providing information to the IDE about various development files (e.g. when
implementing queries).</p></li>

</ul>

<p>A new category of Ant-based project can be registered in the system by
adding an implementation of
{@link org.netbeans.modules.ruby.spi.project.support.rake.RakeBasedProjectType} to the default
lookup. This will get an instance of
{@link org.netbeans.modules.ruby.spi.project.support.rake.RakeProjectHelper} for every project
it creates; the helper does a lot of the work required to interact with the file
structure outlined above.</p>

<p>{@link org.netbeans.modules.ruby.spi.project.support.rake.ActionHelper} provides a number
of utilities which make it easy to run Ant targets.</p>

<p>{@link org.netbeans.modules.ruby.spi.project.support.rake.ReferenceHelper}s can also be
created by an Ant-based project and used to manage references to subprojects and
their artifacts in a high-level manner.</p>

<p>{@link org.netbeans.modules.ruby.spi.project.support.rake.ProjectGenerator} provides the
easiest way to create a new Ant-based project on disk. Use
{@link org.netbeans.modules.ruby.spi.project.support.rake.GeneratedFilesHelper} to make
build scripts and
{@link org.netbeans.modules.ruby.spi.project.support.rake.ProjectXmlSavedHook} to be told when
to recreate them.</p>

<p>{@link org.netbeans.modules.ruby.spi.project.support.rake.PropertyUtils} provides various
methods for working with Ant concepts such as relative file paths, property
substitution, etc.</p>
