<h2>New Ruby on Rails Application Wizard: Name and Location </h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small></p>
<p>
  In this panel of the New Ruby on Rails Application wizard, 
  you set the name of the project and can change its 
  default location. You also specify which Ruby interpreter
  and server to use. You can change the interpreter and server
  later using the project's Properties Manager.
</p>
<p>You get to this panel by choosing File &gt; New Project, and in the New Project wizard, selecting the category Ruby and the project type Ruby on Rails Application.</p>
<ul class="note">
  <li>Clicking the Next button takes you to the the database 
  configuration step, which enables you to use existing IDE 
  connections or to specify database information directly. 
  Clicking Next again opens a panel that enables you to 
  install or update Rails, OpenSSL support, and the Warbler gem. 
  If you have multiple versions of Rails
  installed, the panel also enables you to select which Rails
  version to use in the new project. Clicking
  Finish creates the project without using these options. </li>
</ul>
<p>The panel displays the following options:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Project Name.</b> Specifies the name of the project, which is displayed in the Projects window. This name is also used to create the project folder. </li>
  <li><b>Project Location.</b> Specifies the location where you want to store the project folder.</li>
  <li><b>Project Folder.</b> Specifies the folder in which to store the project files. The folder is a concatenation of the project location and the project name.</li>
  <li><b>Ruby Platform.</b> Select the platform you will use with the project from the drop-down list. If you want to use a platform other than what is displayed in the list, click  Manage to open the Ruby Platform Manager.</li>
  <li><b>Server.</b> Select the server you will use with the project from the drop-down list. </li>
  <li> <b>If Using JRuby.</b> The following option is useful only if you are using JRuby.
      <ul>
      <li> 
        <b>Add Rake Targets to Support App Server Deployment (.war).</b> 
        Choose this option if you want to create a <code>.war</code> 
        file so you can deploy your application to an application 
        server, such as the GlassFish application server.
        When you select this option, the IDE includes the 
        Warbler gem and adds war: rake tasks to the project. 
        If your JRuby repository does not have the 
        Warbler gem, the IDE disables the Finish button.
        You can install the Warbler gem in the fourth step 
        of the wizard. Once the gem is installed, the Finish
        button becomes enabled.
      </li>
      </ul>
