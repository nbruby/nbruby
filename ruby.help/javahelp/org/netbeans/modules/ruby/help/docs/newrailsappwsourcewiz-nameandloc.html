<h2>New Ruby on Rails Application With Existing Sources Wizard: Name and Location </h2>
<p> <small><a href="#seealso">See Also</a>&nbsp; </small> </p>


<p>
  In this panel of the New Ruby on Rails Application With 
  Existing Sources wizard, you must set the project folder 
  to an existing Ruby on Rails project. You can then set the 
  project name, and choose which Ruby interpreter and server to use.
  You can change the interpreter and server
  later using the project's Properties Manager.  
</p>
<p>You get to this panel by choosing File &gt; New Project, and in the New Project wizard, selecting the category Ruby and the project type Ruby on Rails Application with Existing Sources.</p>
<p>The panel displays the following options:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Project Folder.</b> Specifies the folder for an existing Ruby on Rails application. If the application is not a Ruby on Rails application, you see a message in red at the bottom of the panel. </li>
  <li><b>Project Name.</b> Specifies the name of the project, which is displayed in the Projects window. </li>
<li><b>Ruby Platform.</b> Select the platform you will use with the project from the drop-down list. If you want to use a platform other than what is displayed in the list, click the Manage button to open the Platform Manager.</li>
<li><b>Server. </b> Select the server you will use for the application. </li>
<li> <b>If Using JRuby:</b>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Add Rake Targets to Support App Server Deployment (.war).</b> 
    Choose this option if you want to create a <code>.war</code> file so 
    you can deploy your application to an application server, such as  
    the GlassFish application server.</li>
  </ul>
</li>
