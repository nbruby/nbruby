<h2> yield </h2>
<p>Ruby methods can optionally be supplied a block on invocation. This block can optionally be made available as a Proc object using the &amp; prefix on the final parameter of a method, but remains invocable at all times through the yield keyword.
</p><p>The yield keyword looks syntactically just like a method call on the current object. It takes a list of parameters just like method calls and returns a value.
</p>

<pre> yield(1, 2)
 yield 3
 x = yield(4)
</pre>
<p>Even if the block argument is named in a method, code in that method can still invoke the block using yield, instead of calling the Proc object.
</p>
<pre> def both_ways(&amp;block)
   block.call(1)
   yield(1)
 end
</pre>
<p>However, these two forms are not identical. For example, redefinitions of Proc#call will affect the first invocation, but not the second.
</p><p>Much like blocks can be named and captured as Proc objects inside a method, Procs can also be inserted into the block slot at method call time using the &amp; prefix on the last argument of the call.

<pre> def only_uses_yield
   yield
 end
 
 a_proc = proc{ puts "called" }
 only_uses_yield(&amp;a_proc)

</pre>
