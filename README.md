## What

This is a git repo representing mainline development of the hg community-ruby repository.  Most community-ruby hackers should send pull requests here and those changes will be migrated to the official hg repo.

## Why

By still using the hg repository at netbeans.org we can still fit into their full development infrastructure.  One massive bonus is that we get nice ci builds.  The integration tests in particular are very very nice to have running on decent headless hardware.

## Where is the history?

This was a shallow copy from the first non-Oracle release of community-Ruby.  Older history shouldn't be a big concern since we are all new developers on this project.  The truth is...I wanted to keep the repo size down as much as possible.  The original repo was huge.  The moved community-ruby hg repo is smaller...I want this to be even smaller.  The biggest initial barrier nbruby development was waiting the eternity to develop this thing.
